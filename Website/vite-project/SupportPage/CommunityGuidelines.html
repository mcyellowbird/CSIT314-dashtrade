      <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">What are the Community Guidelines?</div>
        <div class="answer">We are a varied group of people from many walks of life. That's why we have a set of common rules and behaviours that our members must adhere to in order for everyone to benefit from our community-based marketplace. These are known as the Community Guidelines. <br><br>

          We strive hard to follow these rules not just because we believe in being transparent and honest, but also so that everyone may enjoy our marketplace.
          <br><br>
          These principles will evolve as we go. We will always be willing to change in order to better serve the DashTrade community as a whole.</div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
