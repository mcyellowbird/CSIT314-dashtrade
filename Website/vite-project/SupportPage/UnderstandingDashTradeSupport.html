            <div class="question">Who and What is a Tradesman?</div>
            <div class="answer">A Tradesman is someone who can do jobs on the DashTrade platform for others. They are an independent contractor who manages member accounts in the same way as Customers and members do on the platform.<br><br>

                If you wish to be a Tradesman, simply register a Tradesman account and begin browsing through assignments that you may perform. Keep in mind that you must be over the age of 18 and have local working privileges. Check out our Community Guidelines for additional details. You may also build a listing to show off your expertise to potential customers. <br><br>
                
                Once you've signed up, you may make offers on projects by explaining to customers and members why you're the ideal person for the job. If you are assigned a task, you can initiate a private message conversation with the Poster to discuss the details of performing the work.

                Please keep in mind that you may only publish tasks in the country in which you presently reside (international tasks are not currently enabled). You must be in the same nation and have local working privileges if you are executing jobs. Both of these requirements are met by remote tasks. <br><br>


                We will make a public notice if we decide to expand into other countries or amend the aforesaid requirements.
